KIOSK SYSTEM OVERVIEW
=====================

PURPOSE:
The kiosk system provides a streamlined self-service interface for students to check in their Chromebooks for repair and check them out after service is completed. It will be deployed on a Chromebook in kiosk mode with an attached barcode scanner.

HARDWARE SETUP:
- Chromebook in kiosk mode
- Connected USB barcode scanner
- Full-screen browser locked to the kiosk page

USER INTERFACE:
Two main tabs are available:
1. Check In - For students dropping off devices for repair
2. Check Out - For students picking up repaired devices

CHECK-IN WORKFLOW:
1. Student scans the barcode on their Chromebook
2. System queries Genesis/Destiny API using the scanned barcode
3. API returns student information (First Name, Last Name, Student ID, School Email)
4. System displays greeting: "Hi [First Last], please fill out the rest of the information below"
5. Pre-populated information is shown to student for verification
6. Student completes remaining form fields:
   - Problem category (dropdown)
   - Have you restarted the computer (dropdown)
   - Additional information (text area)
7. System generates and displays ticket ID number
8. Student receives confirmation message

CHECK-OUT WORKFLOW:
1. Student scans the barcode on their Chromebook
2. System queries Genesis/Destiny API using the scanned barcode
3. API returns student information and associated open ticket
4. System displays greeting: "Hi [First Last], please confirm your information below"
5. Pre-populated information displayed including ticket ID
6. Student confirms information and selects:
   - Chromebook condition (fixed, partially fixed, not fixed)
   - Additional notes (optional)
7. System closes ticket and displays confirmation
8. Student receives checkout confirmation

MANUAL ENTRY FALLBACK:
If barcode scanning fails or student information cannot be retrieved:
- "Not you?" link redirects to manual entry page
- Student manually enters all information:
  - First Name, Last Name
  - School ID (6 digits)
  - School Email
  - Class of (year)
  - Chromebook Serial Number
  - Problem details
  - Restart status
  - Additional information

FUTURE INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Connect to Genesis API for student information retrieval
- Connect to Destiny API as alternative/backup data source
- Integrate with existing ticket database system
- Map barcode scanner input to device serial number lookup
- Implement ticket ID generation and tracking
- Add ticket status tracking between check-in and check-out
- Sync with existing technician dashboard for ticket management

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
- Large, touch-friendly interface elements
- Clear visual hierarchy and navigation
- Consistent branding with existing BucIT pages (maroon color scheme)
- Minimal text input required from students
- Clear success/error messaging
- Auto-reset functionality after each transaction
- Accessibility features for diverse student population

CURRENT STATUS:
- Frontend UI complete (dummy/mock interface)
- No database connectivity
- No API integration
- Static sample data for demonstration
- Ready for visual review and UX testing
